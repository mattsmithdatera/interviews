Matt's Interview Questions

They have a basic encryption that's meant to be easy to break.

This is here for candidates to find.  Part of my interview is making sure they
research their interviewers beforehand.  It's super easy to do the research
these days and yet so few actually do

This is just a small reward for those who go that extra step.  Feel free to
study the questions since it's likely I'll ask something very similar duing my
interviews.
